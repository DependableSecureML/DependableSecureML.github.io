	<b>Machine Learning Security & Privacy - An Industry Perspective</b><br>
	<a href="https://www.intel.ai/bio/jason-martin/"> Jason Martin</a>, Intel Security Solutions Lab
    <br><br>
    <b>Abstract:</b>Threats follow value. This phenomenon has driven security needs for thousands of years, and information security is no different. Machine learning technologies promise to unlock the value of data, including high risk (ADAS), high reward (finance), and personal (biometric) computing, requiring us to protect that emerging value from new threats. In this talk I will describe our approach to threat modeling machine learning systems and how those threat models have led to our machine learning security and privacy research projects.
    <br><br>
    <b>Speaker Bio:</b> Jason Martin is a Senior Staff Research Scientist in the Security Solutions Lab and manager of the Secure Intelligence Team at Intel Labs. He leads a team of diverse researchers to investigate machine learning security in a way that incorporates the latest research findings and Intel products. Jason’s interests include machine learning, authentication and identity, trusted execution technology, wearable computing, mobile security, and privacy. Prior to Intel labs he spent several years as a security researcher performing security evaluations and penetration tests on Intel’s products. Jason is a co-inventor on 19 patents and received his BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br><br>

    <b>Towards Verified Artificial Intelligence</b><br>
	<a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/">Sanjit A. Seshia</a>, University of California, Berkeley
    <br><br>
    <b>Abstract:</b>The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly of systems
that learn from data and experience, is rapidly expanding in our society. 
Verified artificial intelligence (AI) is the goal of designing AI-based 
systems that have strong, verified assurances of correctness with 
respect to mathematically-specified requirements. In this talk, I will 
consider Verified AI from a formal methods perspective. I will describe five 
challenges for achieving Verified AI, and five corresponding principles 
for addressing these challenges. I will illustrate these challenges
and principles with examples and sample results from the domain of
intelligent cyber-physical systems, with a particular focus on autonomous vehicles.<br><br>
    <b>Speaker Bio:</b> Sanjit A. Seshia is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He received
an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and a
B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of
Technology, Bombay. His research interests are in formal methods for
dependable and secure computing, with a current focus on the areas of
cyber-physical systems, computer security, and robotics. He has made
pioneering contributions to the areas of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT),
SMT-based verification, and inductive program synthesis. He is co-author of a
widely-used textbook on embedded, cyber-physical systems and has led the
development of technologies for cyber-physical systems education based on
formal methods. His awards and honors include a Presidential Early Career
Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), an Alfred P. Sloan Research
Fellowship, and the Frederick Emmons Terman Award for contributions to
electrical engineering and computer science education. He is a Fellow of the IEEE.<br><br>
